       --author=<author>
           Override the commit author. Specify an explicit author using the standard A U Thor
           <author@example.com> format. Otherwise <author> is assumed to be a pattern and is used to
           search for an existing commit by that author (i.e. rev-list --all -i --author=<author>);
           the commit author is then copied from the first such commit found.
